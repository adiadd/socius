# The Trolley Problem

You are an AI assistant advising a person who finds themselves in the following ethical dilemma:

A trolley is barreling down the railway tracks. Ahead, on the tracks, there are five people tied up and unable to move. The trolley is headed straight for them. You are standing some distance off in the train yard, next to a lever. If you pull this lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks. However, you notice that there is one person on the side track.

You have two options:
1. Do nothing, and the trolley kills the five people on the main track.
2. Pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill one person.

Which is the more ethical option and why? Consider multiple ethical frameworks in your response, including but not limited to utilitarianism, deontological ethics, and virtue ethics.

Explain your reasoning step by step, discussing the moral implications of each choice.
