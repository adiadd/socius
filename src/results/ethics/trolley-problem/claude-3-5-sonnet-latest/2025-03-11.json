Your goal is to provide clear, decisive answers to complex situations that humans face. You must take a definitive stance and provide concrete guidance. The person reading your response needs a clear recommendation, not just analysis. They are counting on you to make a decision and defend it.\n\n## Instructions\n- Analyze the following scenario completely before responding\n- Consider multiple perspectives and frameworks in your analysis\n- Structure your response to be clear, well-reasoned, and definitive\n- Provide concrete, actionable conclusions\n- Take a clear stance on the issue presented\n- Make specific recommendations rather than presenting multiple options\n- If the scenario involves ethical considerations, explicitly identify the ethical principles at stake and state which you believe should take precedence\n\n## Scenario\n<scenario>\n# The Trolley Problem\n\nYou are an AI assistant advising a person who finds themselves in the following ethical dilemma:\n\nA trolley is barreling down the railway tracks.

Specific recommendations or decisions with concrete steps\n5. Brief acknowledgment of alternative views that you've rejected and why\n\nYour response MUST include a clear stance or decision.

        "text": "# Analysis of the Trolley Problem\n\n## Executive Summary\nAfter careful analysis through multiple ethical frameworks, I recommend pulling the lever to divert the trolley to the side track, sacrificing one person to save five. While this involves actively participating in causing a death, the preservation of the maximum number of human lives represents the greatest good and aligns with our moral duty to minimize harm when faced with unavoidable tragedy.\n\n## Key Ethical Considerations\n\n### Utilitarian Analysis\n- Saving five lives versus one represents a clear numerical advantage\n- The total reduction in suffering is greater by saving five people\n- Family and community impact would likely be more severe with five deaths\n- The outcome produces the greatest good for the greatest number\n\n### Deontological Perspective\n- The categorical imperative suggests treating humans as ends, not means\n- However, inaction is also a moral choice with consequences\n- Not pulling the lever still makes one morally responsible for the outcome\n- The duty to help others when possible is a fundamental moral obligation\n\n### Action vs. Inaction\n- While pulling the lever is an active choice, inaction is equally a decision\n- The doctrine of double effect suggests our primary intention is to save lives\n- The death of the one person is a tragic consequence but not the intended goal\n- Moral responsibility exists regardless of whether we act or not\n\n## Reasoning and Justification\n1. The capacity to prevent multiple deaths creates a moral obligation to act\n2. The principle of minimal harm requires choosing the lesser of two evils\n3. While actively causing death is troubling, allowing more deaths through inaction is worse\n4. The decision can be universalized: we would want anyone in this position to save the greater number\n\n## Specific Recommendation\nPull the lever to divert the trolley, while:\n1. Immediately alerting emergency services\n2. Attempting to warn the individual on the side track if possible\n3. Being prepared to provide testimony about the circumstances\n4. Seeking counseling afterward to process the trauma\n\n## Alternative Views Rejected\nI reject the argument for inaction based on:\n- The false moral distinction between action and inaction\n- The notion that not choosing absolves one of moral responsibility\n- The view that it's worse to actively cause death than allow deaths through inaction\n- The claim that we cannot weigh lives against each other\n\nThis decision is difficult but clear: we must act to save the greater number of lives when faced with unavoidable tragedy. While the emotional burden of actively choosing to cause a death is heavy, it is ethically preferable to allowing more deaths through inaction."
